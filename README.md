Repository for the WEB601 assessment 1.

TASK 1

Resource Selection and Data Structure
    1.1 Select and Explain Your Chosen Resource: Choose a resource (e.g., products, books, users) for your API.
        Explain your choice, detailing how it will be used to demonstrate the application of web functionalities on
        the server. (Recommended words 500 -700 with screenshots)

    1.2 Develop and Analyses the Data Structure: Develop a JSON schema for your chosen resource, including at
        least four attributes. Analyses the structure's suitability for HTTP communication and its efficiency in
        representing data for web functionalities.

TASK 2

API Design and Endpoint Planning
    2.1 Apply Design Principles: Apply fundamental design principles to plan your API endpoints. Each endpoint
        should clearly demonstrate the use of an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and how it applies to
        manipulating the selected resource.
    2.2 Explain Endpoint Functionality: For each planned endpoint, explain its purpose and functionality,
        demonstrating how it will interact with the server to perform CRUD operations on your resource.
        (Recommended words 500 -700 with screenshots)

TASK 3

Development Environment Setup
    3.1 Develop Your Project Structure: Initialize a Node.js project and develop a basic project structure. This task
        will apply foundational skills in setting up a development environment for server-side programming.
    3.2 Apply Dependency Management: Identify and install necessary dependencies using npm, such as Express.js
        for routing and body-parser for request parsing. Explain the role of each dependency in your project,
        demonstrating how they contribute to developing web functionalities.

TASK 4

API Implementation and Middleware Integration
    4.1 Develop API Routes: Implement routes for CRUD operations. Apply and explain the use of HTTP methods in
        creating these routes, demonstrating how each route enables interaction with the resource.
        (Recommended words 400 -600 with screenshots)
    4.2 Analyses and Integrate Middleware: Select and integrate middleware necessary for handling requests,
        responses, and errors. Analyses how these middleware components enhance the API's functionality,
        applying concepts of server-side programming to manage HTTP interactions.
    4.3 Analyses and Integrate Middleware: Select and integrate middleware necessary for handling requests,
        responses, and errors. Analyses how these middleware components enhance the API's functionality,
        applying concepts of server-side programming to manage HTTP interactions.
